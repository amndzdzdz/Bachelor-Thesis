In what follows we are able to extend the literature by making use of the detailed administrative records with respect to sight and savings accounts. The results on the aggregate statistics are in line with the literature see also section 2
Most of the missing information i.e. The field phase was conducted from the third quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2011

"Hence, the nonresponse-adjusted weights are assumed to be very low36, i.e. Assuming that every household in Austria has the same number of savings accounts, there are roughly 330 households with accounts in the second-highest category and only about 60 households with accounts in the highest category"
"To this end, we compare the aggregate values, in line with the approach commonly described in the literature, and additionally cross-check a very detailed breakdown of deposits by banking sectors and by deposit ranges which has not been documented in the literature so far. Concluding remarks This paper examines the similarities and differences between data derived from surveys and from administrative sources, focusing on savings deposits as the main category of households financial wealth in Austria"

"Thus, given the detailed administrative records internally available, this paper adds to the literature demonstrating not only the discrepancies at the aggregate level but also the similar structure in terms of the distribution over asset ranges and banking sectors. The results confirm that the structure of the distribution of deposits is similar in both data sources and the top asset categories are not reached in the HFCS"
"Average deposit holdings in banking statisticsin the HFCS As the banking statistics data show both the volume of deposits and the number of accounts, the average holdings per accounts can be calculated.

Note Savings plans with building and loan association are aggregated to the appropriate sectors. 2 Standard errors cannot be estimated on account of the small number of observations
"26 As mentioned above the ex ante harmonisation of the HFCS points towards the transferability of these results and likely the other results below to the other countries 25 Analysing pension wealth and comparing various data sources might be an important further research project.

"In a next step, some of the most widely used indicators of the new sample can be compared with the estimators of the sample without the imputed households. Thus, it must be assumed that the simulation results represent the upper limit of the possible change"

"Nevertheless, the values according to the banking sectors derived from the administrative records is frequently28 within the 95% confidence interval of the HFCS estimator. The higher banking statistics values of the account data in the individual banking sectors may be attributable to the fact that the HFCS could not capture the households with the highest sight account holdings"
"Savings accounts with very low deposits are responsible for this discrepancy. Only in the first category deposits up to 10,000 and to a much lesser extent in the second category as well are the averages according to the banking statistics data far lower than the corresponding HFCS values"
"Roemer also points out the problems underlying income distributions based on administrative data e.g. For a respondents position in the income distribution, it is after all fairly irrelevant whether his or her annual income is given as USD 2,000 or USD 1,000 even though, in the event of a potentially incorrect response, an absolute difference of 50% between the two sums is quite high"
"Essentially, this finding corresponds to similar comparisons of survey data and administrative records described in the literature section 2. 5 HFCS come to roughly 40% of total financial assets as shown by the financial accounts table 2"

"As data on flows of the household balance sheet, in particular from administrative sources, are more readily available than data on household stocks, most studies have been limited to evaluating information on incomes. Background The comparison of survey data with data derived from administrative sources is a familiar approach in the scientific literature"
"This shows that in a voluntary survey like the HFCS, not just unit nonresponse refusal to participate but also item nonresponse refusal to answer particular questions represents a difficulty, especially when questions cover such sensitive issues.19 As the partial lack of answers cannot be considered purely random, the exclusion of these households commonly referred to as listwise deletion or complete case analysis in the literature results in a distortion of the estimators. An additional 16% of households provided range estimates, as they were unable to indicate specific amounts"

"On the basis of sample design weights and after nonresponse adjustment, the final household weights used in the evaluations in this analysis were post-stratified both by regional distribution of the households and by distribution of household size.11 In particular, this means that the weights were not adjusted to meet the aggregates or the structure of wealth and debt positions of an 8 However, as both surveys refer to Swedish residents aged 50 and over, the results are not fully transferable to the general population. information not provided by respondents was imputed using a Bayesian-based multiple imputation procedure this is explained in more detail below"
This issue is already addressed in the literature see e.g. 19 A related topic to the partial missingness of information is measurement error in surveys
"Simulating households in these two categories including a re-calculation of final household weights with these households allows us to estimate the impact on several statistics. Furthermore, extending the results in the literature, the analysis attempts to answer how the two ranges with the highest savings assets affect key statistics of wealth in savings accounts in the HFCS"
"For the simulated households, the information on household size and geographical location required for the post-stratification process are randomized37 uniform distribution. This last step in defining the final household weights is based on the nonresponse-adjusted weights as well as information on household size and the geographical distribution of households in Austria"
The banking statistics data show a relatively larger number of deposit accounts among the lower deposit categories. The higher estimate for the aggregate value HFCS in the middle savings deposit categories in the joint stock banking sector is also a consequence of the difference between unit of collection at the household and at the account level

"First, we compare the allocation of savings over different deposit ranges and different sectors of the Austrian banking system as these are recorded by both the HFCS and existing national statistics hence the paper goes beyond a comparison of the aggregate statistics. Due to the internal availability of administrative records on financial wealth the paper contributes to the existing literature in the following ways"

"Yet surveys on household assets have a shorter tradition than income surveys.2 For this reason, survey data on incomes have been compared with income data from other sources more frequently and in greater detail in the literature. These data often constitute the only pool of data on household assets that are collected systematically at the micro level"
"self-employed businesses other institutions and estimations e.g. Additionally, however, as will become clearer later on, there are also issues concerning classification of the data households vs"
"Therefore, the value of about 156 billion for total domestic nonbanks is used for the analysis, even though this leads to an overestimation on the side of the administrative data of the total volume of savings deposits of households. However, this total after the separation of the household sector as derived from the banking statistics cannot be broken down further into individual ranges and into banking sectors for the household sector"

roughly 150 billion of 96% can be attributed to households in the financial accounts see table 5. Savings deposits aggregate The overwhelming majority of total savings deposits of domestic nonbanks in Austria i.e

"This underestimation is attributable above all to the aggregation of savings accounts at the household level in the HFCS rather than the account level, as is the case in the banking statistics. 23 category 100,000 to 500,000, HFCS coverage comes to nearly 87% of the total aggregate, but to only 19% of total of savings deposits up to 10,000"
"As early as in 1988, Avery et al. The literature has not produced as many findings on stocks of the household balance sheet"
The aggregate measures derived from administrative sources should provide a reliable estimator. Oversampling in the HFCS may contribute to closing this information gap at the tail of the distribution in the future although due to the extremely low number of accounts in the highest ranges it is by no means guaranteed
"For a respondents position in the income distribution, it is after all fairly irrelevant whether his or her annual income is given as USD 2,000 or USD 1,000 even though, in the event of a potentially incorrect response, an absolute difference of 50% between the two sums is quite high. Using the same datasets, Roemer 2002 is able to show that the surveys accurately capture the underlying patterns of income distribution"
"In the HFCS, the volume of life insurance holdings is calculated as the accumulated premia over the time span of the contract up to the time of the interview, i.e. classified as real assets"
"The survey data provide a wealth of information that complement the administrative data and that are needed in particular to analyse certain groups of the respective target population. A final simulation of the top savings ranges 31 indicates that the estimators such as the Gini coefficient or the arithmetic mean from the HFCS represent at least a lower bound for the true parameters, and that some indicators, in particular robust statistics such as the median and percentiles are affected to a fairly low extent"
"household, however, one is expecting differences in the overall statistics since potentially several accounts are hold by a single household as explained above. Due to the differences in the unit account vs"
"Only in the first category deposits up to 10,000 and to a much lesser extent in the second category as well are the averages according to the banking statistics data far lower than the corresponding HFCS values. As a case in point, the average holdings of deposits in the range from 100,001 to 500,000 come to about 168.000 according to HFCS data the standard error is roughly 19.000, thus matching the banking statistics average of about 168,000"
"Thus, more than two-thirds of total savings deposits 71% are held in the categories spanning the range from 20,000 to 500,000. Because household assets are aggregated in the HFCS, as was mentioned before, whereas the financial accounts cover individual accounts, the HFCS column features larger percentages of deposit holdings in higher categories than the comparable banking statistics categories"

"Assets held in managed accounts are not a separate component of the financial accounts, as they are covered by one of the other categories. However, the HFCS shows that this component has a non-negligible volume"
"2005 examined the coverage of financial assets and liabilities of the household sector in three surveys performed for Italy, the U.S.A., and to some extent for Canada. 1988, Antoniewicz et al"
"Deposits can be allocated to the following ranges based on the administrative account data the HFCS permits any type of classification Up to 10,000 10,000 to 20,000 20,000 to 50,000 50,000 to 100,000 100,000 to 500,000 500,000 to 1,000,000 1,000,000 to 3,000,000 Over 3 million With data available in the banking statistics on both the number of accounts and the total volume of deposits, it is possible to calculate the average deposit holdings per account in a given deposit range for each and every bank sector separately. Given the different definitions, no comparisons of this category were made; it is provided simply for the sake of completeness"
"Essentially, this finding corresponds to similar comparisons of survey data and administrative records described in the literature section 2. 5 HFCS come to roughly 40% of total financial assets as shown by the financial accounts table 2"
"The literature has not produced as many findings on stocks of the household balance sheet. 7 estimators should be low; and, in most studies, the differences between the data result from specification differences definitions of the unit of collection, of types of income, etc."
The banking statistics show that there are some 4.4 million such accounts. 4.2 Sight accounts The account data in the banking statistics and in the HFCS allow for a comparison of the average amounts per account held in sight accounts by Austrian households
"However, for the financial accounts, it is assumed that if a household owns a limited liability company GmbH, it is likely that household members work in this company. In the financial accounts, it is not possible to explicitly capture work of a household member in the business owned by the household"
"As described above, the accounts are classified to that bank at which the household holds the highest amounts. In the HFCS, households are queried directly about their holdings on sight accounts"

Five imputation samples are provided in the HFCS and used in the estimations in this paper. 2012 for an in-depth explanation of the imputation procedure applied
"29 Not surprisingly, aggregate total savings deposits in Austria and average savings deposits are higher in the simulated sample. the range becomes smaller"
"The survey data provide a wealth of information that complement the administrative data and that are needed in particular to analyse certain groups of the respective target population. A final simulation of the top savings ranges 31 indicates that the estimators such as the Gini coefficient or the arithmetic mean from the HFCS represent at least a lower bound for the true parameters, and that some indicators, in particular robust statistics such as the median and percentiles are affected to a fairly low extent"
"Overall, the simulation exercise shows that the HFCS is very well suited to capturing most of the distribution see percentiles even without generating information on the upper ranges of savings deposits. The inclusion of the simulated households with holdings over 6 million has an effect on the Gini coefficient, even if these households have a low weight"
"24 The right half of table 7 indicates that more than two-thirds roughly 70% in total of all savings deposits are in savings accounts with holdings of less than 50,000 according to the banking statistics. 1 No observation in this category"
"However, assuming an even distribution of the accounts, the six simulated households with an average weight of over 400 tend to overrepresent the roughly 400 households cited above. This procedure simulates the relatively low number of accounts in these categories in the banking statistics"
"However, households can be expected to have more than a single account with their so-called house bank. The overwhelming majority of Austrian households use only a single bank more than 91% of respondents in the HFCS and only 2% of households have accounts with more than two different banks"
"Comparing Register and Survey Data. Johansson, F., and A"
"As a case in point, Tormalehto 2011 compares the data collected by the Luxembourg Income Study 6 Group LIS3 with income aggregates in the national accounts. As data on flows of the household balance sheet, in particular from administrative sources, are more readily available than data on household stocks, most studies have been limited to evaluating information on incomes"
"31 See section 6 for an intuitive evaluation of the influence of this underrepresentation using a microsimulation. Therefore, the value of about 156 billion for total domestic nonbanks is used for the analysis, even though this leads to an overestimation on the side of the administrative data of the total volume of savings deposits of households"
"Chart 1, however, shows that Austria might in this regards be an exception with respect to other countries in the HFCS. The specific issues and complexities of pension wealth, however, are not the focus of this study and hence not elaborated on further"
"Although there are differences between the two sources of data most obviously in the way the data are collected, but also in the classificationdefinition of certain types of assets and the unit of data collection, the structure of financial assets is comparable in both data sources. Doing so, one can get a deeper understanding of the similarities and differences of the two datasets that goes beyond the comparison of aggregate values which has been commonly done in the literature so far"
"Conversely, non-robust statistics such as the Gini coefficient or the arithmetic mean of savings deposits change more strongly. The minimal reduction of P90P10 and P90P50 can be explained by the fact that the 90th percentiles increase less than the 10th and 50th percentiles on account of the simulation"
"Furthermore, extending the results in the literature, the analysis attempts to answer how the two ranges with the highest savings assets affect key statistics of wealth in savings accounts in the HFCS. Thus, given the detailed administrative records internally available, this paper adds to the literature demonstrating not only the discrepancies at the aggregate level but also the similar structure in terms of the distribution over asset ranges and banking sectors"
"As in other countries, the comparison of HFCS and financial account aggregates indicates underreporting of comparable household financial wealth in the HFCS in Austria. Comparing estimated aggregates is a common analysis tool to identify differences and similarities between data sources"
"In the individual categories covered by the HFCS, the mean value of both data sources is similar. The table shows clearly that the average amount of deposits in an account does not correspond to the average of Austrian households savings deposit holdings, as households may have several accounts"

"Oversampling of wealthy households could improve the coverage of savings deposits in the HFCS.31 On account of the random selection of households in the stratified multi-stage clustered random sampling of the HFCS, the probability of a household having savings deposits of over 1 million is highly unlikely, as only a total of about 0.03% of savings accounts are classified in the top three categories32. The HFCS does not capture accounts with holdings above 1 million"
"Both types of data are compiled and managed by the OeNB. Data and definitions This analysis is based on two different datasets from Austria,9 data derived from the Household and Finance and Consumer Survey HFCS and administrative banking statistics used to compile the financial accounts"

"With regard to Canada, for which data were available for 1999, the micro data on deposits and total liabilities were around 30% lower than the macro data. 2005 examined the coverage of financial assets and liabilities of the household sector in three surveys performed for Italy, the U.S.A., and to some extent for Canada"
"For the remaining two households, the weight is set at 750, or roughly the fifth percentile in the original sample. for the households in the top deposit range, the weight is 175, or approximately the smallest weight in the original sample, and two households in the secondhighest deposit range, the weight is 300, or roughly the smallest percentile of these weights in the original sample"

"32 References Albacete, N., P. Furthermore, the investigation of measurement error that could not be achieved with the administrative records at hand should yield interesting insights"
"For example, 32.9% of accounts are held in the joint stock banking sector according to banking statistics, and 28.9% of households have accounts in the joint stock banking sector according to HFCS data. 25 The distribution of customer relationships HFCS in the individual cells is very similar to the distribution in banking statistics"
"The aggregation of accounts to the level of households, which is done the HFCS, results in a shift across deposit ranges. The banking statistics do not allow individual accounts to be allocated to households"
"First, households are asked to specify the total amount of their savings deposits, broken down by i savings other than savings with building societies and ii savings with building societies.13 Second, households are asked to indicate which banks they use14 based on a predefined list of the largest 21 banks and an additional verbatim recording for other institutions up to five banks could be reported and to specify how much money they hold in savings accounts and custody accounts at these banks, starting with the bank at which they hold the highest amount. The HFCS in Austria includes one question on sight accounts and two sets of questions on savings accounts"
"Next and additional to what has been done in the literature so far, we provide a cross-check of the HFCS data with the banking statistics used for the compilation of financial accounts in a detailed breakdown of deposits on sight accounts and savings accounts. In line with the approach commonly used in other analyses, we compare aggregate estimates in a first step, in this case for Austria"
"Moreover, a simulation based on the HFCS data serves to demonstrate the effect that the inclusion of savings deposits in the most affluent tail of the distribution has on common statistics. Cross-checking the data shows that the HFCS-based aggregate estimates differ from the financial accounts data, which is line with evidence from the literature, but additionally the paper adds to the literature that the underlying patterns have been captured adequately by the survey at the micro level"

"Hence, the nonresponse-adjusted weights are assumed to be very low36, i.e. Assuming that every household in Austria has the same number of savings accounts, there are roughly 330 households with accounts in the second-highest category and only about 60 households with accounts in the highest category"

"According to the banking statistics, all categories above 500,000 contain a maximum of 0.01% of accounts across all banking sectors and as a total. Hence, the HFCS appears to cover the customer relationship patterns quite well up to a level of about 500,000"

"The number of savings accounts is not explicitly asked for in the HFCS. In addition, some account holders may have in fact forgotten they have accounts with very small holdings, so that the banking statistics may overrepresent actively held savings accounts.30 Table 4 shows the distribution of the number of savings accounts by deposit holdings"

"Thus, these combined holdings make up the largest share of financial assets. This discrepancy is the result of the difficulty described above in capturing pension assets both in the HFCS and in the financial accounts.25 Moreover, it must be pointed out that sight deposits and savings deposits together account for some 41% of financial wealth in the HFCS and some 42% in the financial accounts"

The higher estimate for the aggregate value HFCS in the middle savings deposit categories in the joint stock banking sector is also a consequence of the difference between unit of collection at the household and at the account level. This pattern is similar across all banking sectors
"The field phase was conducted from the third quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2011. Out of a stratified cluster random sample of 4,436 households, 2,380 households agreed to participate in the voluntary survey and were interviewed personally CAPI10 among other things about the different components of household assets and liabilities"
"In line with the approach commonly used in other analyses, we compare aggregate estimates in a first step, in this case for Austria. The results of the comparison are presented in section 4"
"While wages and incomes are nearly identical in both data sources, the data for investment income and self-employment income differ. Kavonius and Torlalehto 2003 compare income aggregates of various sources from survey data5 with national accounts data for Finland"
"The administrative data are subject to some problems, so that an estimate of per capita household wealth in the LWS database equalling 117% of the estimate based on national statistics is not necessarily a sign of a lack of quality of the surveys used. The authors show that the varied sources on which the LWS database is based capture between 13% and 117% of per capita household wealth"

"The result of this calculation on the basis of HFCS data is displayed in the first column of table 4, which indicates the number of customer relationships broken down by deposit ranges and the sum total of about 4.2 million of these relationships. However, the number of customer relationships households in Austria have with different banks can be estimated"
"Additionally, for respondents in the HFCS the classification of certain wealth components as voluntary private pension wealth seemed to be difficult, e.g. If these amounts are added to pension wealth as shown in the financial accounts, the ratio decreases to 65%"

"The results from both data sources show that there is a relatively close match in the structure and the distribution of saving deposits over the banking sectors. In Austria, one can given the internal data availability further analyse compare deposits in more depth"
because illegal work and related income are not captured in the administrative data. Roemer also points out the problems underlying income distributions based on administrative data e.g
"Factoring in the simulated households causes the Gini coefficient to go up by some 2.5 points about 4% of the rise in inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient. Conversely, non-robust statistics such as the Gini coefficient or the arithmetic mean of savings deposits change more strongly"

In Austria the estimate of comparable aggregate financial wealth in the survey is around 44% of the according figure in the National Accounts. The analysis sets out from the well-known fact in the literature that comparable aggregate financial wealth is underestimated in surveys
"Using several examples, the authors demonstrate that the administrative data are biased, so that it must not be assumed that the administrative data fully capture reality. Errors are found not just in survey data, but also in the administrative data"
"The impact on robust statistics such as the median or the percentile ratios is very small The median of savings deposit amounts rises by just 0.1%, for example. However, the quality of the simulation is also reflected by the absolute rise by some 5 billion, so that the aggregate in the top two categories of the banking statistics is fully covered"

"The HFCS captures premia, but not any profit participation or service charges of the insurance providers. The financial accounts data are based on insurance technical reserves23"
"Moreover, table 3 shows that the relative sizes of the means in the individual banking sectors are similar for both data sources. The mean of the sight account deposits at mortgage banks has a very high standard error, signalling both the uncertainty of the estimator and the large range of the holding values in the mortgage bank sector"
This difference is again attributable to choice of unit of collection. A broad view of all categories in the individual sectors reveals that the middle categories in all sectors are somewhat overestimated whereas the categories at the upper and lower ends are underestimated
"Summing up, no huge differences between the HFCS data and the administrative data can be found in the structure of average holdings in the sight accounts over the banking sectors. This might be due to the high share of pension accounts in this sector assuming that the elderly population has a higher liquidity preference"
"For instance, in the financial accounts, financial wealth resulting from debt of a household to the respondents household is not covered, as relevant data are not available. Certain subcomponents are not covered by either of the two data sources"
"Given the structure of the HFCS, where all accounts of a household are totalled, it might be expected that average deposits tend to be higher. household, however, one is expecting differences in the overall statistics since potentially several accounts are hold by a single household as explained above"
"Consequently, the two data sources are not meant to replace each other; much rather, they serve as complementary sources for analysing households in an economy where reliable distributional estimates can be calculated from the HFCS and aggregate values from the financial accounts. Furthermore, the distribution across banking sectors and asset ranges of deposits is relatively similar in both data sources"

"In the case of investment in publicly traded shares, the respective shares are 3% HFCS and 5% financial accounts. 17 in the sight account the figures in both sources match almost exactly"
"Therefore, especially in the lowest deposit categories, the number of accounts is distorted upward in the banking statistics of active accounts. The assumption of the number of 35 By law, accounts usually ones with very low holdings expire after a period of 30 years after the last movement has been registered"

"As in other countries, the comparison of HFCS and financial account aggregates indicates underreporting of comparable household financial wealth in the HFCS in Austria. Comparing estimated aggregates is a common analysis tool to identify differences and similarities between data sources"
"In theory, it is still possible to hold anonymous accounts even today, as the requirement imposed on banks is to identify accounts only if there are withdrawals or payments into the account. Opening anonymous accounts has been prohibited by law since 2000;17 since then customers have been required to provide identification when opening an account"
"However, for the financial accounts, it is assumed that if a household owns a limited liability company GmbH, it is likely that household members work in this company. In the financial accounts, it is not possible to explicitly capture work of a household member in the business owned by the household"
"In addition, the portion of the value that is unitand index-linked may fluctuate on account of market price changes, a circumstance that would apply to about one-fifth of all life insurance policies. Thus, insurance technical reserves represent the total of the premia paid and the profit share net of benefits received and of service charges"
"However, the table indicates that i the allocation of financial wealth reflected by HFCS data broadly mirrors the financial accounts patterns and that ii the coverage ratio of the HFCS compared with the financial accounts varies considerably for individual financial instruments and components. This value may be considered fairly high in an international comparison with other surveys see also section 2.22 The origins of this difference can be manifold; on the one hand the survey estimates might not cover the totality of the financial assets as we will see later in more detail, but on the other hand the financial accounts data do not solely reflect financial wealth of households as they include selfemployed business assets and single person companies and thus overestimate financial wealth of the households"

"This is due to the differences of the unit of collection, which is a savings account attributed to the household sector in the banking statistics and a household in the HFCS, which on average holds more than one savings account. The distribution of aggregate saving deposits over asset holding ranges is at the household level in the HFCS shifted to higher ranges in comparison to the data from the banking statistics used in financial accounts"

"Thus the estimate of households gross assets is quite similar in both data sources. However, this difference is offset by the discrepancy between the two data sources with regard to the wealth of households, which is held in the households main residence if they own it rather than rent it"

"The cross-checking results from the second set of questions amounts held at different banks are in the appendix to this study as a sensitivity analysis and in general confirm the findings of the paper.

These data from the banking statistics are an important component of the financial accounts. The focus of our analysis is not just on establishing the discrepancies between the aggregate values as documented in the literature for similar international surveys but above all on assessing the allocation of deposits to small ranges of volume and to the different sectors of the Austrian banking system
"Thus, more than two-thirds of total savings deposits 71% are held in the categories spanning the range from 20,000 to 500,000. Because household assets are aggregated in the HFCS, as was mentioned before, whereas the financial accounts cover individual accounts, the HFCS column features larger percentages of deposit holdings in higher categories than the comparable banking statistics categories"

The authors show that the varied sources on which the LWS database is based capture between 13% and 117% of per capita household wealth. 2006 compare the data of the Luxembourg Wealth Study LWS7 for several countries with national statistics
As expected there is a stronger effect on the estimates of aggregate level of savings wealth and accordingly on the mean from the survey data of about 9%. This results points towards reliability of the robust statistics from surveys even so the highest asset ranges are not covered
"The reason is the financial account definition of pension wealth in the financial accounts, which currently covers claims on pension funds of singleemployer and multi-employer occupational pension funds and of the OeNB, but not companies technical pension provisions some 13 billion or the claims on severance funds some 3.5 billion.

"28 households is ad hoc, but is justified for two reasons First, the assumption reflects the higher amount of accounts in the second-highest deposit range in the banking statistics, and second, it allows for the assignment of different weights to the households.

"On the basis of sample design weights and after nonresponse adjustment, the final household weights used in the evaluations in this analysis were post-stratified both by regional distribution of the households and by distribution of household size.11 In particular, this means that the weights were not adjusted to meet the aggregates or the structure of wealth and debt positions of an 8 However, as both surveys refer to Swedish residents aged 50 and over, the results are not fully transferable to the general population. information not provided by respondents was imputed using a Bayesian-based multiple imputation procedure this is explained in more detail below"

The households are assigned a weight, and the distributional indicators are then calculated with and without these households"

"Simulating households in these two categories including a re-calculation of final household weights with these households allows us to estimate the impact on several statistics.

"Based on the flags18 used for the variable for deposits on savings accounts HD1210, table 1 shows that only about 56% of respondent households provided the exact amount of holdings in savings accounts.

Background The comparison of survey data with data derived from administrative sources is a familiar approach in the scientific literature. The analysis is rounded up with concluding remarks and suggestions for further research
"The financial accounts in Austria The financial accounts are an integral part of the national accounts and as such compiled in accordance with the rules of the European System of Accounts 1995 ESA 9512 based on data derived from a variety of administrative sources. Hence, differences between the two separate data sources are to be expected; they have not been reduced or ruled out ex ante in the production process"
"Table 9 highlights two important aspects, namely i the total average of deposit holdings column 2 is higher according to the HFCS data than according to the banking statistics, and ii amounts beyond 500,000 are not covered, a confirmation of the known finding. For the HFCS data, the calculation of the standard error of the respective mean in a cell is based on 1,000 resampling weights contained in the HFCS data"
"As data on flows of the household balance sheet, in particular from administrative sources, are more readily available than data on household stocks, most studies have been limited to evaluating information on incomes. Background The comparison of survey data with data derived from administrative sources is a familiar approach in the scientific literature"
"The HFCS already includes observations albeit very few in the category with savings of 500,001 to 1,000,000. The following simple simulation makes it possible to quantitatively assess how some indicators would change if the HFCS sample contained households with savings in the two top categories savings of over 1 million"

"This shows that in a voluntary survey like the HFCS, not just unit nonresponse refusal to participate but also item nonresponse refusal to answer particular questions represents a difficulty, especially when questions cover such sensitive issues.19 As the partial lack of answers cannot be considered purely random, the exclusion of these households commonly referred to as listwise deletion or complete case analysis in the literature results in a distortion of the estimators. An additional 16% of households provided range estimates, as they were unable to indicate specific amounts"
"Consequently, assets in this part of the distribution are underestimated. As explained in the section on households customer relationships with banks, the HFCS does not contain information about the two highest deposit categories"
"Although all forms of data compilation come with their own specific problems, various difficulties attached to surveys attract special criticism, such as nonparticipation or nonresponse. The innovation of the Household Finance and Consumption Survey HFCS is that it provides a harmonised framework for collecting information on euro area households financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that represents a basis for euro area wide analyses"

"Table 7 additionally provides an analysis of the shares of individual banking sectors and deposit categories in total savings deposits.

The banking statistics show that there are some 4.4 million such accounts. 4.2 Sight accounts The account data in the banking statistics and in the HFCS allow for a comparison of the average amounts per account held in sight accounts by Austrian households
"Detailed breakdowns according to the banking sector and asset holding ranges are under investigation. These are saving deposits, accounting for more than one third of the financial assets in both the survey and the financial accounts data"
"This underestimation is attributable above all to the aggregation of savings accounts at the household level in the HFCS rather than the account level, as is the case in the banking statistics. 23 category 100,000 to 500,000, HFCS coverage comes to nearly 87% of the total aggregate, but to only 19% of total of savings deposits up to 10,000"
because illegal work and related income are not captured in the administrative data. Roemer also points out the problems underlying income distributions based on administrative data e.g
"Table 3 shows both the arithmetic mean and the standard error of holdings on sight accounts by banking sector. As described above, the accounts are classified to that bank at which the household holds the highest amounts"
This difference is again attributable to choice of unit of collection. A broad view of all categories in the individual sectors reveals that the middle categories in all sectors are somewhat overestimated whereas the categories at the upper and lower ends are underestimated
"This procedure simulates the relatively low number of accounts in these categories in the banking statistics. In the procedure, the weights of the new total of 2,386 households are adapted in line with the distribution of household size and geographical location in Austria as taken from the Statistics Austria microcensus.38 After post-stratification, the weights of the simulated households average39 423 408 prior to post-stratification, whereas all other households have an average weight of around 1,600"
"By contrast, the banking statistics in the financial accounts capture the information on eurodenominated savings accounts not by households but by accounts. in a home for the elderly, monastery, military compound, or prison are part of the target population, irrespective of their nationality, and thus have a positive probability of being selected for the HFCS sample"
"30 These forgotten accounts are by law kept alive for 30 years upon which they expire if no bank transfer apart from interest payment occurs in this period. Moreover, the table shows that the aggregation of a potentially many accounts results in the 29 As described above, customers typically attribute their building society savings plan to their house bank even though legally speaking, the deposits are held with another bank a building society"

"Historical background and imputations In the Austrian financial landscape, savings accounts used to enjoy a special position for a very long time, as depositors were able to hold numbered accounts and thus remain anonymous. Given the structure of the HFCS, where all accounts of a household are totalled, it might be expected that average deposits tend to be higher"
"The inclusion of the simulated households with holdings over 6 million has an effect on the Gini coefficient, even if these households have a low weight. In the original calculation, the Gini coefficient is calculated for a bandwidth of 0 to less than 1 million"

The micro data newly generated through the HFCS and the detailed internally available breakdowns of savings deposits in the existing macro data Financial Accounts lend themselves to a more in-depth analysis of the similarities and differences in these two sources than what has been done in the literature so far. Michael Andreasch Oesterreichische Nationalbank; e-mail michael.andreasch@oenb.at Peter Lindner Oesterreichische Nationalbank; e-mail peter.lindner@oenb.at 1 This paper compares the survey results on savings deposits and estimates on total financial assets from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey HFCS in Austria with administrative records from the national accounts for the household sector
"According to the banking statistics, all categories above 500,000 contain a maximum of 0.01% of accounts across all banking sectors and as a total. Hence, the HFCS appears to cover the customer relationship patterns quite well up to a level of about 500,000"
The reason for this fairly strong effect is the widening of the wealth bandwidth in deposits. Factoring in the simulated households causes the Gini coefficient to go up by some 2.5 points about 4% of the rise in inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient
"However, the number of customer relationships households in Austria have with different banks can be estimated. The number of savings accounts is not explicitly asked for in the HFCS"

The objectives of the network are 1 understanding economic behaviour of individual households, developments in aggregate variables and the interactions between the two; 2 evaluating the impact of shocks, policies and institutional changes on household portfolios and other variables; 3 understanding the implications of heterogeneity for aggregate variables; 4 estimating choices of different households and their reaction to economic shocks; 5 building and calibrating realistic economic models incorporating heterogeneous agents; 6 gaining insights into issues such as monetary policy transmission and financial stability"
"These banking statistics data are not suited to show the distribution of savings by households in Austria, but only by accounts. The banking statistics data show a relatively larger number of deposit accounts among the lower deposit categories"

"Additionally, for respondents in the HFCS the classification of certain wealth components as voluntary private pension wealth seemed to be difficult, e.g. If these amounts are added to pension wealth as shown in the financial accounts, the ratio decreases to 65%"
"Furthermore, the investigation of measurement error that could not be achieved with the administrative records at hand should yield interesting insights. However, very little useful administrative data on real assets is available"
"For example, 32.9% of accounts are held in the joint stock banking sector according to banking statistics, and 28.9% of households have accounts in the joint stock banking sector according to HFCS data. 25 The distribution of customer relationships HFCS in the individual cells is very similar to the distribution in banking statistics"

"It must be pointed out that fewer than 1% of accounts as shown by the banking statistics are in the category from 100,000 to 500,000 and that the HFCS estimates for this category are generally also of the same order with the exception of the category joint stock banks. This difference is again attributable to choice of unit of collection"
"Accounts with MFIscustomer relationships with banks in the HFCS To explore further similarities and differences between the two data sources beyond the aggregates and aggregate shares, we analyse the allocation of customer relationships with banks in the HFCS and of the numbers of accounts in the banking statistics. This means in particular that nearly 7% of the total undercoverage in the HFCS can be attributed to the top two categories"
"This result is echoed by the micro data for Italy, which are based on the Survey on Household Income and Wealth SHIW the estimate for total financial assets in the SHIW came to 31% of the corresponding macro data. With regard to Canada, for which data were available for 1999, the micro data on deposits and total liabilities were around 30% lower than the macro data"
"For instance, the smaller banking sectors the industrial credit cooperatives and the mortgage banks account for deposit shares of 7% and 3% according to HFCS data. The allocation of deposit holdings to the individual banking sectors is broadly the same in the HFCS and in the financial accounts"
"Simulating households in these two categories including a re-calculation of final household weights with these households allows us to estimate the impact on several statistics. Furthermore, extending the results in the literature, the analysis attempts to answer how the two ranges with the highest savings assets affect key statistics of wealth in savings accounts in the HFCS"
A broad view of all categories in the individual sectors reveals that the middle categories in all sectors are somewhat overestimated whereas the categories at the upper and lower ends are underestimated. The gap in the Raiffeisen credit cooperative sector is even smaller at 30.5% banking statistics versus 30.2% HFCS

In Austria the estimate of comparable aggregate financial wealth in the survey is around 44% of the according figure in the National Accounts. The analysis sets out from the well-known fact in the literature that comparable aggregate financial wealth is underestimated in surveys
"Only in the first category deposits up to 10,000 and to a much lesser extent in the second category as well are the averages according to the banking statistics data far lower than the corresponding HFCS values. As a case in point, the average holdings of deposits in the range from 100,001 to 500,000 come to about 168.000 according to HFCS data the standard error is roughly 19.000, thus matching the banking statistics average of about 168,000"
"The banking statistics do not allow individual accounts to be allocated to households. In addition, we consider the effects of the different units of aggregating savings deposits in the banking statistics accounts based and in the HFCS household based"

Michael Andreasch Oesterreichische Nationalbank; e-mail michael.andreasch@oenb.at Peter Lindner Oesterreichische Nationalbank; e-mail peter.lindner@oenb.at 1 This paper compares the survey results on savings deposits and estimates on total financial assets from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey HFCS in Austria with administrative records from the national accounts for the household sector
"However, the quality of the simulation is also reflected by the absolute rise by some 5 billion, so that the aggregate in the top two categories of the banking statistics is fully covered. While the increase by 9% is economically significant, it cannot fully explain the entire underrepresentation see table 2 in section 4"
Hence we are convinced that also the remaining results in this study are a reasonable indication for other countries as well. With some exceptions the structural pattern in other countries seems to reflect broadly what is found in Austria
The distribution of aggregate saving deposits over asset holding ranges is at the household level in the HFCS shifted to higher ranges in comparison to the data from the banking statistics used in financial accounts. The results from both data sources show that there is a relatively close match in the structure and the distribution of saving deposits over the banking sectors

"Doing so, one can get a deeper understanding of the similarities and differences of the two datasets that goes beyond the comparison of aggregate values which has been commonly done in the literature so far. This classification is due to banking supervisory reporting requirements, which call for a reporting of both the number of accounts and aggregate savings in these pre-specified magnitudes"

"The financial accounts data are adjusted for this type of financial wealth to make the equity data compatible with the definitions underlying the HFCS. However, for the financial accounts, it is assumed that if a household owns a limited liability company GmbH, it is likely that household members work in this company"
"Next and additional to what has been done in the literature so far, we provide a cross-check of the HFCS data with the banking statistics used for the compilation of financial accounts in a detailed breakdown of deposits on sight accounts and savings accounts. In line with the approach commonly used in other analyses, we compare aggregate estimates in a first step, in this case for Austria"
"As a case in point, the average holdings of deposits in the range from 100,001 to 500,000 come to about 168.000 according to HFCS data the standard error is roughly 19.000, thus matching the banking statistics average of about 168,000. In the individual categories covered by the HFCS, the mean value of both data sources is similar"

"The literature has not produced as many findings on stocks of the household balance sheet. 7 estimators should be low; and, in most studies, the differences between the data result from specification differences definitions of the unit of collection, of types of income, etc."
"If a respondent left the verbatim recording blank, the relationship was classified in the other national category, since these responses could not be classified to a banking sector ex post.16 In the banking 15 In the alternative calculation in the annex, households are mapped with the amounts held in the respective banks with the possibility to report up to five different banks. In case the household wanted to state a different bank, a verbatim recording was available"
"The mean of the sight account deposits at mortgage banks has a very high standard error, signalling both the uncertainty of the estimator and the large range of the holding values in the mortgage bank sector. Nevertheless, the values according to the banking sectors derived from the administrative records is frequently28 within the 95% confidence interval of the HFCS estimator"
The banking statistics data show a relatively larger number of deposit accounts among the lower deposit categories. The higher estimate for the aggregate value HFCS in the middle savings deposit categories in the joint stock banking sector is also a consequence of the difference between unit of collection at the household and at the account level
"With a ratio of the LWS database to the national balance sheet of between 65% and 117%, the match between micro and macro data of nonfinancial assets is closer than that of financial assets with an LWS to NBS ratio of between 13% and 52%. The administrative data are subject to some problems, so that an estimate of per capita household wealth in the LWS database equalling 117% of the estimate based on national statistics is not necessarily a sign of a lack of quality of the surveys used"
"The volume of savings deposits is also underestimated in the HFCS in the lower categories. Consequently, assets in this part of the distribution are underestimated"
"As a case in point, the average holdings of deposits in the range from 100,001 to 500,000 come to about 168.000 according to HFCS data the standard error is roughly 19.000, thus matching the banking statistics average of about 168,000. In the individual categories covered by the HFCS, the mean value of both data sources is similar"
"For example, 32.9% of accounts are held in the joint stock banking sector according to banking statistics, and 28.9% of households have accounts in the joint stock banking sector according to HFCS data. 25 The distribution of customer relationships HFCS in the individual cells is very similar to the distribution in banking statistics"
"The results confirm that the structure of the distribution of deposits is similar in both data sources and the top asset categories are not reached in the HFCS. Additionally, mean holdings and relative number of accounts according to the banking sector and holding category are discussed in the paper"
"Table 7 additionally provides an analysis of the shares of individual banking sectors and deposit categories in total savings deposits. So we see with the Austrian HFCS data not only the already in the literature documented underestimation of aggregates in surveys see sections 2 and 4.1, but also see in particular coverage rates in the different deposit categories and in the different banking sectors"

"Historical background and imputations In the Austrian financial landscape, savings accounts used to enjoy a special position for a very long time, as depositors were able to hold numbered accounts and thus remain anonymous. Given the structure of the HFCS, where all accounts of a household are totalled, it might be expected that average deposits tend to be higher"
The focus of our analysis is not just on establishing the discrepancies between the aggregate values as documented in the literature for similar international surveys but above all on assessing the allocation of deposits to small ranges of volume and to the different sectors of the Austrian banking system. in the middle of the field phase of the HFCS for comparison with the HFCS results
"The innovation of the Household Finance and Consumption Survey HFCS is that it provides a harmonised framework for collecting information on euro area households financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that represents a basis for euro area wide analyses. Yet surveys on household assets have a shorter tradition than income surveys.2 For this reason, survey data on incomes have been compared with income data from other sources more frequently and in greater detail in the literature"

The financial accounts distinguish between holdings of shares quoted and unquoted and other equity. Another category not covered by the HFCS is that of agreed nonlife insurance claims that have not been paid out yet
"Hence, many persons and households have several savings accounts, but the amounts held in these accounts are fairly small see table 4 roughly 81% of accounts contain deposits of less than 10,000. 4.3 Comparison of savings deposits Comparison of number of accounts The banking statistics of the financial accounts documented roughly 23.5 million savings accounts as at end-2010, and according to information provided by Statistics Austria, some 8.4 million persons 3.7 million households according to the HFCS estimate live in Austria"
"Only in the first category deposits up to 10,000 and to a much lesser extent in the second category as well are the averages according to the banking statistics data far lower than the corresponding HFCS values. As a case in point, the average holdings of deposits in the range from 100,001 to 500,000 come to about 168.000 according to HFCS data the standard error is roughly 19.000, thus matching the banking statistics average of about 168,000"

In Austria the estimate of comparable aggregate financial wealth in the survey is around 44% of the according figure in the National Accounts. The analysis sets out from the well-known fact in the literature that comparable aggregate financial wealth is underestimated in surveys
"Detailed breakdowns according to the banking sector and asset holding ranges are under investigation. These are saving deposits, accounting for more than one third of the financial assets in both the survey and the financial accounts data"
"Cross-checking the data shows that the HFCS-based aggregate estimates differ from the financial accounts data, which is line with evidence from the literature, but additionally the paper adds to the literature that the underlying patterns have been captured adequately by the survey at the micro level. The micro data newly generated through the HFCS and the detailed internally available breakdowns of savings deposits in the existing macro data Financial Accounts lend themselves to a more in-depth analysis of the similarities and differences in these two sources than what has been done in the literature so far"

"Thus, more than two-thirds of total savings deposits 71% are held in the categories spanning the range from 20,000 to 500,000.

Although there are differences between the two sources of data most obviously in the way the data are collected, but also in the classificationdefinition of certain types of assets and the unit of data collection, the structure of financial assets is comparable in both data sources"

The banking statistics data show a relatively larger number of deposit accounts among the lower deposit categories. The higher estimate for the aggregate value HFCS in the middle savings deposit categories in the joint stock banking sector is also a consequence of the difference between unit of collection at the household and at the account level
"This classification is due to banking supervisory reporting requirements, which call for a reporting of both the number of accounts and aggregate savings in these pre-specified magnitudes. the first range or category goes from no wealth to EUR 10.000 and the highest one is over EUR 3 million"

The aggregate measures derived from administrative sources should provide a reliable estimator. Oversampling in the HFCS may contribute to closing this information gap at the tail of the distribution in the future although due to the extremely low number of accounts in the highest ranges it is by no means guaranteed

The distribution of the individual components of comparable financial assets is relatively similar in both data sources. The financial accounts data are adjusted for this type of financial wealth to make the equity data compatible with the definitions underlying the HFCS
"The cross-checking results from the second set of questions amounts held at different banks are in the appendix to this study as a sensitivity analysis and in general confirm the findings of the paper.

For the banking statistics the average holdings in sight account in joint stock banks is relatively high. The biggest differences is seen for the sector of state mortgage banks for which the standard error in the HFCS is enormous and hence the variability of the data very high
"Separate savings accounts and partly also savings plans with building societies are also kept for children; in the HFCS, these are obviously counted as part of household wealth. As account maintenance charges are low some Austrian banks do not charge any maintenance fees for accounts, people often have several savings accounts so that they can react quickly to interest rate differentials"
"In the original calculation, the Gini coefficient is calculated for a bandwidth of 0 to less than 1 million. The reason for this fairly strong effect is the widening of the wealth bandwidth in deposits"

"The most obvious one is that data from the financial accounts are publicly only available at the aggregate level and thus it is not possible to attempt a distributional analysis. Doing so, one needs to bear in mind that also the macro data exhibit certain weaknesses"
"The analysis below extends the literature on the one hand by looking at detailed categories in terms of asset ranges and banking sectors and on the other hand by simulating the potential impact of the highest saving levels on commonly used statistics. However, Kavonius and Honkkila 2013 also only look at a comparison of aggregated values"
The banking statistics data show a relatively larger number of deposit accounts among the lower deposit categories. The higher estimate for the aggregate value HFCS in the middle savings deposit categories in the joint stock banking sector is also a consequence of the difference between unit of collection at the household and at the account level
This difference is again attributable to choice of unit of collection. A broad view of all categories in the individual sectors reveals that the middle categories in all sectors are somewhat overestimated whereas the categories at the upper and lower ends are underestimated
"The biggest differences is seen for the sector of state mortgage banks for which the standard error in the HFCS is enormous and hence the variability of the data very high. For example, the smallest mean in both data sources is to be found in the Volksbank credit cooperative sector"

"For instance, in the savings deposit 33 As described in section 3, the following tables are based on the information provided on savings deposits; this data is attributed to banking sectors on the basis of the bank at which a household holds the highest amount of deposits. The volume of savings deposits is also underestimated in the HFCS in the lower categories"
"Factoring in the simulated households causes the Gini coefficient to go up by some 2.5 points about 4% of the rise in inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient. Conversely, non-robust statistics such as the Gini coefficient or the arithmetic mean of savings deposits change more strongly"
"First, we compare the allocation of savings over different deposit ranges and different sectors of the Austrian banking system as these are recorded by both the HFCS and existing national statistics hence the paper goes beyond a comparison of the aggregate statistics. Due to the internal availability of administrative records on financial wealth the paper contributes to the existing literature in the following ways"
